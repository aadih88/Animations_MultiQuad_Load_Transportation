## Figure 12
This figure covers the case of a nonlinear quadrotor model motion with target moving in straight line,<br>

* K<sub>P</sub> = 0.3
* K<sub>Pr</sub> = 1
* K<sub>D</sub> = 0.9
* K<sub>Dr</sub> = 1.8
* K<sub>D\[\alpha\]</sub> = 0.2
* K<sub>Dr\[\alpha\]</sub> = 0.2
* K<sub>P\[\alpha\]</sub> = 0.3


Control is applied along the line-of-sights of the quadrotors and target and in the lateral directions.

The position of the quadrotors (Q1 and Q2) are plotted in two-dimensional space over time, showing the trajectory, instantaneous velocity and acceleration input directions. The target (T) is displayed in green. The load is displayed as a black bar between the quadrotors, with green ends signifying an extension and magenta, a compression in the connecting ends. The circles about the target on which the quadrotors have to settle are also displayed for clarity.
