# Animations_MultiQuad_Load_Transportation

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Two quadrotors transport a load while they follow a static or moving target which may follow complex trajectories (presented here are circular and lawnmower trajectories of the target). A lawnmower trajectory of the target is presented for agriculture spraying applications.

Each folder is for a particular figure from the paper titled "Multi-Quadrotor Distributed Load Transportation for Autonomous Agriculture Spraying Operations" submitted to the Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics (AIAA). Each animation (zipped files) is accompanied by a readme file describing the simulation case, the reference commands (distances and pose), and gains used in the simulation. The detailed plots for the animations are provided in the paper above. Please use these animations as reference to understand more about the plots in the paper. The discussion about each simulation case is handled in the paper, and not here.<br>

A brief outline of the animations presented here:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Figs. 6 through 12 are for a static target</li>
  <li>Figs. 13 through 17 are for straight-line motion of the target</li>
  <li>Figs. 18 through 20 are for circular motion of the target</li>
  <li>Figs. 21 through 24 are for target executing a lawnmower pattern</li>
</ol>

The position of the quadrotors (Q1 and Q2) are plotted in two-dimensional space over time, showing the trajectory, instantaneous velocity and acceleration input directions. The target (T) is displayed in green. The load is displayed as a black bar between the quadrotors, with green ends signifying an extension and magenta, a compression in the connecting ends. The circles about the target on which the quadrotors have to settle are also displayed for clarity.
