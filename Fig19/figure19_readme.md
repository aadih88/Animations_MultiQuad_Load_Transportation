## Figure 19
This figure covers the case of a Nonlinear model of quadrotor motion and a target moving on a circle of radius = 10 m, with constant speed <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\|v_T\| = 1">m/s. Wind with velocity <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=v_a = [2,2,0]^T">m/s and sensor noise are considered here. Control is applied along the line-of-sights of the quadrotors and target and in the corresponding lateral directions. The quadrotors are placed on either side of the target, such that the three are collinear. The gains for the simulation are:<br>

The position of the quadrotors (Q1 and Q2) are plotted in two-dimensional space over time, showing the trajectory, instantaneous velocity and acceleration input directions. The target (T) is displayed in green. The load is displayed as a black bar between the quadrotors, with green ends signifying an extension and magenta, a compression in the connecting ends. The circles about the target on which the quadrotors have to settle are also displayed for clarity. The reference distances and angales are:<br>
